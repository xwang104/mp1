        <h2>Momoko "Maruko" Sakura (さくらももこ)</h2>
        <p>Maruko is a nine-year-old third-grade student raised in a relatively poor family of six. She is lazy, disorganized and usually late for school. Maruko, like many kids, tries to avoid homework and chores, and she takes advantage of her doting grandfather and squabbles with her sister. Nevertheless, she is a well-meaning child who tries to do good. She often uses adult-like language to express her childlike feelings. She loves reading manga and is a good artist, and her stated goal is to become a manga artist when she grows up.</p>
